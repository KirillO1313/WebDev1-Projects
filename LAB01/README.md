## Assignment description
The assignment involved building a webpage about a randomly assigned tallest mountain; the key constraint of the assignment was that external stylesheets were not permitted, so all styling was done using inline style attributes on HTML elements.

## My Experience 
Although I had prior self-taught experience with HTML and CSS (GradeCalculator Repo coming soon!), this project was a helpful refresher on syntax and structure. 

## Status
The current version is the original submission, with plans to improve styling and add features such as an interactive map.
