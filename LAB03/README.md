## Assignment Description
This assignment required creating two responsive versions of a webpage for an imaginary animal shelter. 
The page needed to display animals available for adoption, include a navigation menu, and present general 
information about the organization. Each version was designed to support three different screen sizes, using 
different approaches to responsive design.
+ Version A uses CSS media queries to control layout and styling across screen sizes.
+ Version B uses Bootstrap to implement a responsive layout using its grid system and components.
  
## My Experience
Between the two approaches, I preferred working with media queries, as I understand them better and find the 
resulting code cleaner and easier to follow. Bootstrap felt more restrictive by comparison, mainly due to its 
limited set of predefined breakpoints and the continued need for custom CSS for finer control. That said, 
I didn’t spend enough time with Bootstrap to fully explore its strengths, and I can see how it could become a 
significant time-saver once I’m more comfortable with it, since responsive layouts can be built with less custom CSS.

## Status & Structure
#### Version A (Media Queries)
indexA.html: HTML for Version A

styleA.css: CSS for Version A (uses media queries)

Status: Complete

#### Version B (Bootstrap)
indexB.html: HTML for Version B

styleB.css: Custom CSS for Version B

Status: Partially complete
