## Assignment Description
This lab consisted of two JavaScript-focused problems.
###### Problem 1:
Display a list of website links, including an icon indicating whether each site uses http or https.
###### Problem 2:
Allow the user to enter a string, determine whether it is a palindrome, and display a message indicating the result.

## What I Learned
This lab covered core JavaScript concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, and DOM manipulation. 
###### Problem 1: 
I created an array of site objects and dynamically added them to the page as ```<li>``` elements. Each list item 
displays the site’s name, link, and a connection-type icon. A for loop and a helper function were used to 
generate and append each list item to the DOM.
###### Problem 2:
The palindrome check is triggered using a button’s onClick event. The associated JavaScript function validates 
the input (ensuring it is not empty and does not contain numbers), processes the string using helper functions, 
and determines whether it is a palindrome. A message is then displayed based on the result.
