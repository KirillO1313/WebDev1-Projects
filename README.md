# WebDev1-Projects
A collection of lab assignments from my Intro to WebDev course. Some projects are presented as originally submitted, while others are undergoing improvements with additional features, refinements, and fixes, especially those that didn’t initially receive full marks.

**LAB 1: intro HTML/CSS** 
Although I had prior self-taught experience with HTML and CSS, this project was a helpful refresher on syntax and structure. The assignment involved building a webpage about a randomly assigned tallest mountain; the key constraint of the assignment was that external stylesheets were not permitted, so all styling was done using inline style attributes on HTML elements.
The current version is the original submission, with plans to improve styling and add features such as an interactive map.

**LAB 2: more HTML/CSS**
  

**LAB 3: HTML/responsive CSS/bootstrap**
