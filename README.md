# WebDev1-Projects
A collection of lab assignments from my Intro to WebDev course. Some projects are as originally submitted, while others are in the process of being improved with additional features, refinements, and fixes, especially the labs that didn’t originally receive full marks.

**LAB 1: intro HTML/CSS**
  While I had prior self-taught experience with HTML and CSS, this project was a helpful refresher on syntax and structure. The assignment involved building a webpage about a     randomly assigned tallest mountain; the current version is the original submission, with plans to improve styling and add features such as an interactive map.

**LAB 2: more HTML/CSS**
  

**LAB 3: HTML/responsive CSS/bootstrap**
